### Rules of Quarto

Quarto is a game where where players take turns placing pieces on a 4x4 board.
Each piece has a unique combination of four properties. A piece may be:
  - Tall/Short
  - Square/Round
  - Light/Dark
  - Hollow/Solid

A player wins when he or she connects four of a kind on a row, column, or
diagonal all sharing at least one property. A stalemate occurs when you have
placed all sixteen pieces on the board and no column, row, or diagonal has four
of a kind.

### Problem Statement

How many stalemates are there in the game of Quarto, and what are they?
Warning: It's a big number. Don't actually try saving them unless you have a way
to store them efficiently.

### Variations
Players may also win by grouping four of a kind in a 2x2 square.
