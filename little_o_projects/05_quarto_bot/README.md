Quarto Bot
=========

### Rules of Quarto

Quarto is a game where where players take turns placing pieces on a 4x4 board.
Each piece has a unique combination of four properties. A piece may be:
  - Tall/Short
  - Square/Round
  - Light/Dark
  - Hollow/Solid

A player wins when he or she connects four of a kind on a row, column, or
diagonal all sharing at least one property. A stalemate occurs when you have
placed all sixteen pieces on the board and no column, row, or diagonal has four
of a kind.

### Problem Statement

There is a Quarto bot battling framework over at
[HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/quarto). The goal
is for everyone who has time/inclination to write a bot that plays the
game in this format. We will then either just test our bots, or battle
them to the death.

### Variations

This testing framework accepts lots of languages: try something new!
